    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) arises from the squamous epithelium of the larynx and is associated with a high incidence of cervical lymph node metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in the epigenetic regulation of cellular biological processes, including cancer metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms of specific miRNAs responsible for LSCC metastasis and their clinical significance have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, LSCC cohort datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were downloaded and examined by comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, which revealed that upregulation of mRNA SERPINE1 and downregulation of miR-181c-5p were associated with unfavorable overall survival. Our analysis showed that SERPINE1 expression negatively correlated with the expression level of miR-181c-5p in our LSCC patient samples. Silencing of miR-181c-5p expression promoted cell migration and invasion in cell lines, whereas the overexpression of miR-181c-5p suppressed cell migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the downregulation of SERPINE1. Further analysis showed that the enhancement effect on EMT and metastasis induced by silencing miR-181c-5p could be rescued through knockdown of SERPINE1 expression in vitro. Collectively, our findings indicated that miR-181c-5p acted as an EMT suppressor miRNA by downregulation of SERPINE1 in LSCC and offers novel strategies for the prevention of metastasis in LSCC. </p></div>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Tracheal stenosis is an obstructive disease of the upper airway that commonly develops as a result of abnormal wound healing. We evaluated the anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties of nintedanib on tracheal stenosis both in vitro and in vivo. An animal model of tracheal stenosis was induced via tracheal trauma. Postsurgical rats were orally administered with nintedanib (10 or 20 mg/kg/d) or saline (negative control) for 2 weeks, and tracheal specimens were harvested after 3 weeks. Degree of stenosis, collagen deposition, fibrotic surrogate markers expression, and T-lymphocytic infiltration were evaluated. Human fetal lung fibroblast-1 (HFL-1) cells were cultured to determine the effects of nintedanib on changes of cellular biological function induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Rat tracheal stenotic tissues exhibited thickened lamina propria with irregular epithelium, characterized by significantly increased collagen deposition and elevated TGF-β1, collagen I, α-SMA and fibronectin expressions. Nintedanib markedly attenuated the tracheal stenotic lesions, reduced the collagen deposition and the expression of fibrotic marker proteins, and mitigated CD4+ T-lymphocyte infiltration. Additionally, cellular proliferation and migration were decreased dose-dependently in TGF-β1-stimulated HFL-1 cells when treated with nintedanib. Furthermore, nintedanib inhibited TGF-β1-induced HFL-1 differentiation and reduced the mRNA levels of the profibrotic genes. TGF-β1-activated phosphorylation of the TGF-β/Smad2/3 and ERK1/2 pathways were also blocked by nintedanib. Nintedanib effectively prevented tracheal stenosis in rats by inhibiting fibrosis and inflammation. The antifibrotic effect of nintedanib may be achieved by inhibiting fibroblasts' proliferation, migration and differentiation and suppressing the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.</p></div>

(2): 321&ndash;351. <br><button class="accordion">
  Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is characterised by a dismal prognosis; nonetheless, limited studies have unveiled the mechanisms underlying HNSCC relapse. Next-generation sequencing was performed to identify the somatic mutations in 188 matched samples, including primary tumours, tumour-adjacent tissues (TATs), pre- and post-operative plasma, saliva and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from 27 patients. The evolutionary relationship between TATs and tumours were analysed. The dynamic changes of tumour- and TAT-specific mutations in liquid biopsies were monitored together with survival analysis. Alterations were detected in 27 out of 27 and 19 out of 26 tumours and TATs, respectively. TP53 was the most prevalently mutated gene in TATs. Some TATs shared mutations with primary tumours, while some other TATs were evolutionarily unrelated to tumours. Notably, TP53 mutations in TATs are stringently associated with premalignant transformation and are indicative of worse survival (hazard ratio = 14.01). TAT-specific mutations were also detected in pre- and/or post-operative liquid biopsies and were indicative of disease relapse. TATs might undergo the processes of premalignant transformation, tumorigenesis and eventually relapse by either inheriting tumorigenic mutations from ancestral clones where the tumour originated or gaining private mutations independent of primary tumours. Detection of tumour- and/or TAT-specific genetic alterations in post-operative biopsies shows profound potential in prognostic use. </p></div>

   Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in otolaryngology head and neck surgery and is one of the worst prognostic malignant tumors. Endogenous circular RNA (circRNA) is more stable than mRNA, microRNA (miRNA), and long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) in exosomes, plasma, and urine, and participates in gene expression regulation to perform different functions. Therefore, circRNA is expected to become a biomarker and therapy target for many tumors. However, the expression and function of circRNA regulated by N6-methyladenosine (m6A) are still unclear in HNSCC. In this study, we demonstrated that a specific circRNA, circCUX1, was upregulated in HPSCC patients who are resistant to radiotherapy and predicts poor survival outcome. We further found that methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) mediated the m6A methylation of circCUX1 and stabilizes its expression. Knockdown circCUX1 promotes the sensitivity of hypopharyngeal cancer cells to radiotherapy. In addition, circCUX1 binds to Caspase1 and inhibits its expression, resulting in a decrease in the release of inflammatory factors, thereby developing tolerance to radiotherapy. Our findings indicate that circCUX1 is a potential therapeutic target for radiotherapy tolerance in HPSCC patients.</p></div>

   Abstract   
    </button>   
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Hypopharyngeal cancer has relatively high incidence rates in China, especially in high-risk areas. However, data on the role of major risk factors in these areas of China are still limited. We have evaluated the roles of alcohol, tobacco and betel quid consumption, and oral health, based on 278 hypopharyngeal cancer cases and 693 controls from two centers in Central South China. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values were estimated using logistic regression. We found that alcohol drinkers had a risk of hypopharyngeal cancer that was up to seven times higher than that for those who had never drunk. A very strong effect of traditional liquor as compared to other alcohol types was observed, with the OR reaching 11.26 (CI 6.53-19.41) for this cancer. Tobacco smokers were up to four times more likely to develop hypopharyngeal cancer than never smokers. The OR for betel quid chewing was 1.86 (CI 1.26-2.75) as compared to never users. Poor oral hygiene had a risk of hypopharyngeal cancer that was two times higher than that for normal oral hygiene. In this study, we have shown for what is believed to be the ﬁrst time the association of increased hypopharyngeal cancer incidence with alcohol, tobacco, betel quid and oral hygiene in China. Alcohol may play a larger role for hypopharyngeal cancer in this population than in populations in other areas. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">To detect the expression level of tRNA-derived fragments secreted by extracellular vesicles in hypopharyngeal cancer and explore the influence of tRNA-derived fragments on the occurrence of hypopharyngeal cancer and lung metastasis. After high-speed centrifugation, tRNA, which was extracted from the extracellular vesicles of patients with hypopharyngeal cancer and healthy subjects, was sequenced using microarrays. The expression of three differentially expressed tRNAs in hypopharyngeal cancer, healthy subjects, human normal laryngeal epithelial cells and hypopharyngeal cancer line was detected by qRT-PCR. The correlation between the upregulated tRNA, as identified by qRT-PCR, and the clinicopathological features of the non-lung metastatic patients was further analyzed. Finally, the expressions of upregulated tRNA were compared between the non-lung metastatic and lung metastatic patients. The risk factors of hypopharyngeal cancer with lung metastatic were identified by the Cox regression analysis. By high-speed centrifugation, extracellular vesicles were extracted successfully. It was found that a variety of tRNAs in the extracellular vesicles from patients with hypopharyngeal cancer by sequencing. qRT-PCR validation indicated that tRF-1:30-Lys-CTT-1-M2 was significantly overexpressed in hypopharyngeal cancer patients and tumor cells, especially in lung metastatic patients. It was indicated that tRF-1:30-Lys-CTT-1-M2 overexpression was closely related to such pathological features as tumor staging, differentiation grade, smoking history and drinking history. According to the Cox regression analysis, stage III–IV, smoking history, drinking history and tRF-1:30-Lys-CTT-1-M2 overexpression were independent risk factors for metastasis of hypopharyngeal cancer. tRF-1:30-Lys-CTT-1-M2 was overexpressed in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer and was identified as an independent risk factor for lung metastasis. It can be used as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and lung metastasis monitoring of hypopharyngeal cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common human malignant tumor globally, with an overall 5-year survival rate exceeding HNSCC of approximately 50%. Patients with HNSCC often experience low absolute lymphocyte counts, spontaneous apoptosis of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, defects in natural killer (NK) cell activity, and impaired antigen presentation. Hence, the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) regulatory mechanism should be further explored to optimize personalized immunotherapy management significantly. First, using the TCGA database and GEO database obtained the RNA sequencing expression profile data of HNSCC patients. Then, a series of comprehensive bioinformatics identified several key immune prognostic markers. Then, we evaluated the expression pattern of OPN and NK cell infiltration in fresh specimens. We further used the tumor-lymphocyte co-culture method and chemotaxis test to verify the effect of OPN on NK cell function in vitro. Next, we will study the binding effect and regulatory relationship of integrin and OPN both in vitro and in vivo assay. </p></div><br>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Laryngeal tracheal stenosis (LTS) refers to a disease in which the laryngotracheal cartilage stent is deformed, collapsed, or defective due to various reasons, and the scarring of the laryngotracheal mucosa or the proliferation of submucosal tissues cause breathing difficulties. At present, there is no reliable treatment for LTS so far.  Based on the results of previous experimental research, this project proposes that CD4 T cells may bind to PDL1 on the surface of fibroblasts through PD1, thereby inhibiting the occurrence of scar fibrosis from balancing the growth by macrophages. Two major scientific questions need to be demonstrated: i) whether CD4 T cells regulate the growth of fibroblasts through PDL1; ii) whether the inhibition effect by CD4 T cells can be balanced out by macrophage-stimulating factor (M-CSF). This project uses the related technology of tissue engineering to apply to the treatment research of otolaryngology-related diseases. In short, the research provides new sights for the immunotherapy of LTS patients in the future.</p></div><br>
